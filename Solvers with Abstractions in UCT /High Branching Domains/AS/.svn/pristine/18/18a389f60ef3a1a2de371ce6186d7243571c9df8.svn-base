Examples for instance small-graphs/test00_10.graph:

Use depth=10 (as there are 10 steps to go to the end of MDP), parameter p=0.5,
and w/ 10 expansions per iteration. The width is set to 400.

To run ctp3 for 100 trials, using AOT with the min-min heuristic and breaking ties
in selection of best action randomly, do

  ./ctp3 -t 100 small-graphs/test00_10.graph min-min aot/heuristic,random-ties 400 10 .5 10

To run ctp3 for 100 trials, using AOT with the zero heuristic and breaking ties
in selection of best action randomly, do

  ./ctp3 -t 100 small-graphs/test00_10.graph zero aot/heuristic,random-ties 400 10 .5 10

To run ctp3 for 100 trials, using AOT with optimistic base and breaking ties in selection
of best action randomly, do

  ./ctp3 -t 100 small-graphs/test00_10.graph optimistic aot/random-ties 400 10 .5 10
